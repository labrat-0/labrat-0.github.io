# 🧪 WEASEL Tools: Supercharging Windows 11 with Linux 🐧 & Neovim

## Why I Built This

Most Windows users prefer clicking through GUIs to view and edit files. I’m not one of them.

I love the keyboard. I live in the terminal. And I’ve always preferred the control and speed that comes with working inside Linux—especially with tools like `Neovim`, `tmux`, and `fzf`. That’s where the idea behind **WEASEL Tools** was born.

I needed a fast, keyboard-driven environment inside Windows, powered by **WSL2**. Something that felt like home—my Linux setup—but fully operational within Windows 11. And that’s exactly what this toolkit delivers.

## What WEASEL Tools Is

**WEASEL (Windows Enhanced and Accelerated Shell Environment for Linux)** is an automated setup script that configures a fast, minimal, and powerful environment in WSL2 using Ubuntu LTS. It installs:

- ✅ **Neovim** with powerful productivity plugins (Telescope, Harpoon, LSPs)
- ✅ **tmux** with clean keybindings for pane and window management
- ✅ **Zsh** with aliases and a clean, informative prompt
- ✅ Essential CLI tools like `ranger`, `fzf`, `ripgrep`, and more
- ✅ A full `keybinds.md` file that documents all your shortcuts in one place

## The Experience

I underestimated how productive old-school, terminal-first setups could be—until now.

This workflow transformed how I move through my day. I can:
- Jump between documentation, project code, and terminal output with a few keystrokes.
- Quickly search my knowledge base using `fzf` and `ripgrep`.
- Stay completely keyboard-focused with minimal friction.

Once the muscle memory kicks in, there’s no going back. The keybindings feel natural, and the efficiency boost is real.

And here’s the best part: **I didn’t have to give up Windows.** Thanks to WSL2, I get the best of both worlds—Linux speed and tools inside the Windows ecosystem, complete with Git, plugin managers, and a thriving community of contributors.

## Getting Started

If you want to try it for yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/labrat-0/weasel-tools.git
cd weasel-tools/
chmod +x weasel-tools.sh
./weasel-tools.sh
```

Just follow the prompts, restart your terminal, and you’re good to go.

## What I Learned

- Keyboard-driven workflows aren’t just for hardcore Linux users—they can be adapted to any system with the right tools.
- Productivity often comes down to **speed of access**—being able to switch contexts quickly is a game changer.
- The modern plugin ecosystem makes it surprisingly easy to integrate powerful tools into a custom workflow.
- Terminal setups don’t have to be intimidating. With a little guidance, they can be empowering.

## Final Thoughts

**WEASEL Tools** is more than a setup script—it’s a mindset. One that embraces the power of simplicity, speed, and muscle memory. If you’ve ever wanted to bring serious Linux workflow power into your Windows environment, this might just be the toolset that makes it click.
